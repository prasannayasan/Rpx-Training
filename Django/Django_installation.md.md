# Installation

1.Installing Python 3.6.2

2.Installing Virtualenv

Below steps are to install pip for python 3.6

    - ```sudo python3.6 get-pip.py```
Below steps are to install virtualenv
    - ```sudo pip3.6 install virtualenv```

I am going to create a folder named development for my further projects and in it i am creating project folder to to hold this new project.

3.Creating new folder project
- ```mkdir project```
- ```cd project```

4.Installing virtual environment with python
- ```virtualenv venv -p python```

After running the above command our virtual environment is created. Now before we start using it, we need to activate:
- ```source venv/bin/activate```

5.Installing Django 1.11.4
- ```pip install django```

6.Starting a New Project
- ```django-admin startproject project```
- ```python manage.py runserver```

7.Go to the directory where the manage.py file is and executes the following command:
- ```django-admin startapp first```

8.Add our first project to installed apps in settings.py
9.Add following code to view.py in first app.
```{```
```from django.http import HttpResponse```

```def home(request):```
```    return HttpResponse('Hello, World!')```
```}```

10.Now we have to tell Django when to serve this view. It’s done inside the urls.py file:
{
from django.conf.urls import url
from django.contrib import admin

from first import views

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$', views.home, name='home'),
    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
}

11. Finally run the server.
- ```python manage.py runserver```
